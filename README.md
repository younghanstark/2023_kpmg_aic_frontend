# 2023_KPMG_AIC_FRONTEND

[2023 KPMG Ideathon Challenge - AIC]

## Overview

This is an front-end web app which allows users to use AIC's awesome features, such as question & answering task in business context. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `serve -s build`

Deploy the `build` folder.\
This command will serve the static site on the port 3000. The port can be adjusted using the `-l` flags like `serve -s build -l 4000`.
